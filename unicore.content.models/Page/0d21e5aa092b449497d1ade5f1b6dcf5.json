  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA I had just given birth at the hospital when the nurse\nhanded me my baby girl. She said: you must give her your breast now. Then she\nwalked away. I was in shock. How do I feed her? I had no idea... I put her\nmouth to my nipple and thought she would suck. But she didn\u2019t. She didn\u2019t seem\nto know what to do or how to get my breast into her mouth. All night I tried.\nAnd my baby was crying and crying. Eventually I got my nipple into her mouth\nand she would suck a bit then stop. But she would wake up again and cry and\nwant more. It went on like this all night. But she did pass her first poo.\nThen she slept almost the whole day. When I left the hospital the next day, it\nwas the same story at home. She was up all night crying and then slept most of\nthe day. Luckily at home I\u2019ve had my mother to help. But it\u2019s been a few\nsleepless nights now and the exhaustion is getting to me. Baby has her own\nideas about when to sleep. So my life is in reverse. I am up all night but\ncan\u2019t really sleep in the day. I can\u2019t remember when I last slept properly. My\nbaby cries a lot and I am not sure she is getting enough milk. I don\u2019t know if\nI should give her formula as well because she seems so hungry. I keep on and\non trying. She looks as if she is gaining weight and she is passing stools and\nurine just fine. But she feeds non-stop and when I remove my breast she cries.\nI think I am the one who needs support. **MAMA HELP: Newborn babies really are\nhard work! They cry a lot. They also feed a lot. But if your baby is gaining\nweight, passing stools and has wet nappies, then you\u2019re both doing well.\nRemember to take your baby back to the clinic for regular check-ups. The nurse\nwill make sure she is growing and feeding well.**\n\n",
