  "content": "Brought to you MAMA \r\n\r\nTwo months ago, I left my job to look for work that I can do from home. I do need to work to bring in extra money \u2013 but I\u2019m pregnant with my second child. \r\n\r\nWe didn\u2019t plan to have another baby right now. My husband has been taking on extra work to make more money. It\u2019s tough because now he is hardly ever at home and we don\u2019t see much of each other. \r\n\r\nFor the past two months I\u2019ve been waking up at 5am to do some housework before my little one wakes and I get her ready for school. After I have taken her to school, I walk around the neighbourhood looking for work. I ask if there are any cleaning jobs I could do. I pick my daughter from school at 2pm, and then I have to keep her entertained, start making supper and the cleaning routine starts again.\r\n\r\nBecause I am so far into my pregnancy, I am heavy and tired all the time. I want to sit down and put my feet up, but there is no time for that. I have to do odd jobs and try to make what money I can. Now, I am wondering what it's going to be like when I have two. A toddler and a newborn. \r\n \r\nI have no time for my husband. I\u2019m pregnant and exhausted. So how will I find time for my new baby or myself? Somehow I know that I must cope. Many women have done it before me. But sometimes it feels impossible. \r\n\r\n\r\n**MAMA HELP: Are you expecting your 2nd or 3rd child? You will need help. Reach out to trusted older family members and friends who have children. If you are tired and alone, you may not be able to give your best to your children. Ask for help and share child-minding duties with others.** \r\n",
