  "content": "Created by BabyCenter Inside your womb, your baby wakes and sleeps at regular\nintervals now. He can now open and close his eyes, and suck his finger or\nthumb! This helps develop his sucking muscles so that he is strong enough to\nfeed as soon as he is born. His brain is growing and developing quickly now.\nHe can respond to sound now. At first, he will only hear sounds from your\nbody, like your heartbeat. But slowly he will start to hear noises from\noutside your body. Sing to your baby so he can hear your voice. It may feel\nlike your womb is up near your ribcage, which will make you feel out of\nbreath. Eating can be difficult because your stomach may be squeezed by your\ngrowing baby. Have small meals more often and snacks between meals. As your\nbaby grows so does your womb. The skin over your belly stretches and this can\nitch. You may notice red streaks on your tummy, hips, bottom and breasts. They\nare stretch marks and they will fade to faint marks after you give birth. You\nmay have leg cramps or swollen veins. Your breasts are fuller and heavier now.\nThis is because they are getting ready to make milk for your baby.\n\n",
