  "content": "Created by BabyCenter \r\n\r\nNow your baby in your womb looks like a tiny newborn\r\nbaby. Her eyes, eyebrows and eyelids have developed and her teeth are growing\r\nunder her gums. The taste buds on her tongue are developing. She will be able\r\nto taste your milk from the first feed. \r\n\r\nShe has a creamy white substance\r\ncovering her skin. This protects your baby\u2019s skin and helps with the birth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout this time, you may begin to feel your baby's movements. It feels like\r\ntiny bubbles inside you. At first, you may not be sure what it is. Gradually\r\nthe movements become stronger and you can then be sure that it is your baby\r\nkicking. It is an exciting moment! \r\n\r\nYou could also start to feel breathless now\r\nand you may feel clumsy. This is because you are carrying more weight and your\r\nbump affects your balance. \r\n\r\nYou may have a heavier discharge and want to\r\nurinate more often. If you notice some bleeding when you brush your teeth, it\r\nis because your pregnancy hormones are making your gums swell and become sore,\r\nwhich can lead to bleeding. Brush every day, but be gentle.\r\n\r\n",
