  "content": "Created by BabyCenter Now your baby Is about the size of your hand. He is\ngrowing, and developing all his senses. When he is born he will be able to\nsee, taste, smell and hear. The circle of darker skin around your nipples will\nbe getting larger as your breasts grow. This helps your baby to find the\nbreast once he is born and makes it easier for him to latch on and get milk.\nYou may find your breasts grow quite quickly and feel much heavier. Your skin\nmay be changing as well. Dark patches of skin may develop on your face. Or you\nmay get a dark line down your tummy. These can be made worse by being out in\nthe sun, so cover your skin and head, or stay in the shade. They will fade\nafter your baby is born. Pregnancy makes the joints in your body looser. So\nyou may find you get aches and pains when you carry something heavy. Take care\nwhen lifting things. Divide heavy shopping into smaller loads. You may need\nmore rest as well. Try to rest each afternoon and go to bed early if you are\nfeeling tired. Growing a baby is hard work!\n\n",
