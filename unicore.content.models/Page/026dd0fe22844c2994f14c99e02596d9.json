  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA My baby was a beautiful newborn. Even the nurses told\r\nme how pretty she was. She had a lot of dark hair and perfect little\r\nfingernails. I felt so proud to show her off! But after 2 weeks she started to\r\nget pimples all over her face. They started on her left cheek and spread to\r\ncover her whole forehead and chin. She also had crusty areas over her\r\neyebrows, behind her ears and in her hair. It didn\u2019t look very nice. I felt\r\nembarrassed when people asked to see her. Sometimes I was tempted to squeeze\r\nher pimples. But my mother told me it was better to leave them alone \u2013 no\r\nspecial creams or ointments, just clean water. Luckily she couldn\u2019t see\r\nherself and didn\u2019t seem to mind! I found it difficult to look at other babies.\r\nWhy did they look so perfect when my baby was covered in spots? I worried that\r\nthey would never go away. I wondered what had caused them. Was it something I\r\ndid or ate when I was pregnant? Luckily by the time she was 6 weeks old the\r\nspots had gone and her skin was smooth again. She still had some crusts on her\r\nhead but they were hard to see because of her hair. She\u2019s back to being the\r\nbeautiful baby she was when she was born, just a bit chubbier now! **MAMA\r\nHELP: Most bumps and blotches on a newborn baby are harmless and clear up by\r\nthemselves. Your baby\u2019s new skin is adjusting to the world.**\r\n\r\n",
