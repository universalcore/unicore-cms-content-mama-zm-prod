  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA There are so many people giving me advice about feeding\r\nmy newborn baby. I just don't know what to think! Some of my friends say I\r\nmust stick to certain times in the day to feed my baby like every 4 hours on\r\nthe hour. But I can't possibly let her cry when she seems to be hungry. And I\r\ncan't force her to drink when she is not. So I just pick her up when she is\r\nrestless and starts to niggle and put her on my breast. Usually she latches on\r\nand starts drinking until she is full. Then my breast, which was quite hard\r\nand full before, becomes soft and feels empty. I try to let her drink from\r\nboth my breasts. This relieves the discomfort I feel when they get too full.\r\nMy baby usually becomes very sleepy after drinking, so I gently hold her\r\nupright and let her burp. Then I put her down to sleep again. Judging from the\r\nsize of her yellow and smelly poop, she must get enough food! Then another\r\nmother told me that I must give her cooled, boiled water between feeds from\r\nwhen she is 6 months. It\u2019s because babies can get dehydrated. It is quite hot\r\nin the day, so I thought I would give it a try. But my baby has not sucked on\r\nanything else but my breasts. So when I tried to put a cup in her mouth, she\r\npulled a face and didn't want it. She makes 3 to 4 big wees in the day. The\r\nurine is pretty clear and not yellow or dark. So I think that she drinks\r\nenough liquid. Her skin is also rosy and her face gets rounder every day. I\r\nhad her weighed at the clinic and she is putting on the right amount of\r\nweight. So I am starting to relax now! I found my way. My nipples were quite\r\nsore in the beginning. Then somebody told me that my baby has to take my\r\nbreast further into her mouth. My nipple mustn\u2019t get squeezed on her hard\r\npalate. It must rather be further back in her mouth, where it is softer. Since\r\nI did that, it doesn\u2019t hurt anymore when I feed her. Sometimes she doesn\u2019t\r\nlatch on properly and then I let her open her mouth wider and latch on again.\r\nSometimes it works right away. But sometimes we both have to try a couple of\r\ntimes. It gets easier the more often we do it. Now I find breastfeeding easy\r\nand natural. It\u2019s so convenient! I can go anywhere and feed my baby wherever I\r\nwant to. MAMA HELP: Your baby is getting enough milk if she is having regular\r\nfeeds, 6 to 8 wet nappies a day and gaining weight. She needs no food or\r\nliquid other than breastmilk for the first 6 months.\r\n\r\n",
