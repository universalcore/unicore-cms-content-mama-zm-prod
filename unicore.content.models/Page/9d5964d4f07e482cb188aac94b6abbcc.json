  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA I thought that once I delivered my baby, my tummy would\r\ngo back to normal. But I gave birth 6 weeks ago and I still look pregnant! I\r\ncannot fit into any of my clothes and I am still wearing my pregnancy pants. I\r\ntried to squeeze myself into a pair of pre-pregnancy pants 2 days after the\r\nbirth. I was amazed that I could not get them higher than my knees! Yesterday\r\nI tried again. I just couldn\u2019t wait to get back into normal clothes. I tucked\r\nhandfuls of fat into the waistband. I finally got the button closed. \\- \u201cCome\r\nlook!\u201d I called to my husband. \u201cI can fit back into my clothes!\u201d The look of\r\nsurprise on his face said it all: it was not good. \u201cWear them round the house\r\nuntil you are comfortable going out in public in them,\u201d he suggested. I took\r\nthem off 10 minutes later. But only because they were too tight to sit down\r\nin. Now I am really feeling worried. Will this stomach ever go down? \\- \u201cGive\r\nyourself time,\u201d my friends tell me. \u201cThe baby weight will come off in time.\u201d\r\n\u201cHow much time?\u201d I ask. \u201cA year,\u201d they promise. I can\u2019t believe it. A 40-week\r\npregnancy and now I still look pregnant! **MAMA HELP: It is normal for a\r\nhealthy pregnant woman to put on 10 to 14kgs (20 to 30 lbs) by the end of your\r\nterm. The extra weight will give you a cushion for the months when you\r\nbreastfeed your baby. You can work at losing the weight over time to get your\r\nshape back.**\r\n\r\n",
