  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA When I started breastfeeding my newborn baby, nobody\r\nreally told me what to do. I wanted to do everything as naturally as I could.\r\nAfter all, nursing animals don\u2019t get taught how to feed their newborns, do\r\nthey? Well, I managed quite well for a few days. Then the nipple of my left\r\nbreast got really sore. Soon after that I felt a hard lump in my breast. It\r\nwas red and hot. My friend told me this was a blocked milk duct or mastitis.\r\nShe said I had to be careful it didn\u2019t turn into an infection! How had this\r\nhappened? My breasts had become very large and really full with milk. They had\r\nturned into tight soccer balls, with a tiny nipple sticking out. My baby tried\r\nto grab and suck on my nipple to get milk out. But I didn\u2019t know that the\r\nbreast actually has to go further into the baby\u2019s mouth. My nipple had to be\r\nat the back of the mouth towards the throat and not at the front where the\r\nlips are. So my baby was not sucking properly. But now my breast was hard and\r\npainful! I started massaging the hard spot while I was breastfeeding, trying\r\nto get all the milk out of the breast to take the swelling down. Then friends\r\ntold me about cabbage leaves! You put them into the fridge and wrap them cold\r\naround your breast. You keep them there for an hour or two. You can change\r\nthem for fresh ones when they become warm and wilted. So I tried it! And along\r\nwith the massaging while feeding, I also put a warm cloth on to soften the\r\nlump. After 3 days, the lump was gone and my breast was soft again not hard\r\nand hot like before! Thank goodness! **MAMA HELP: Mastitis will improve if you\r\ncan keep the milk flowing through your breasts. Don't stop feeding, as this\r\nwill make it worse. See that your baby gets a good mouthful of breast. Try\r\ndifferent breastfeeding positions to help her latch on.**\r\n\r\n",
