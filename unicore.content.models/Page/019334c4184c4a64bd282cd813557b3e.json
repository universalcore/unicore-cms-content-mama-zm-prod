  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA As soon as my baby was born I held her tight. I wanted\r\nsome time with her first. I knew that all my baby needed was to lie on my\r\nchest with me. The best incubator in the world is between my breasts. That is\r\nwhat a baby needs: food, warmth and touch. I listened to my instincts as a new\r\nmom. It was the time for my new family to be together. My baby was hearing the\r\nvoices of her parents for the first time. I spoke to her while her dad made\r\nnoises and sang. I put her to my breast. At first she only licked my nipple\r\nand then suckled for a few seconds before giving up. It took the help of the\r\nmidwife to show both of us how to get her to latch on properly. That took at\r\nleast an hour. Now when I feed her I can see her sparkling eyes looking at me.\r\nThe time for bathing and weighing will come. I will make sure she gets all her\r\nvaccinations on time. But not yet. Now it\u2019s time to get to know her. Deep down\r\nI know that the best thing I can do right now is to feed her often and keep\r\nher close. **MAMA HELP: Your time with your newborn is precious. You have both\r\ndone such a good job! Spend time bonding and cuddling. It is the first time\r\nyou are meeting this precious bundle. The world can wait...**\r\n\r\n",
