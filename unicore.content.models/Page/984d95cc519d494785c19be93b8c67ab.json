  "content": "Brought you you by MAMA I thought I would get morning sickness, weird food\ncravings and swollen breasts during pregnancy. I thought I would feel loving\nand emotional \u2013 or different in some way. But I feel totally normal! Honestly\nI can understand those girls who say that they didn\u2019t even know they were\npregnant! If I hadn\u2019t missed a period and gone to the clinic for a test, I\nwould never have known. No morning sickness. No cravings. I feel nothing. My\nlife just goes on as always. I can\u2019t stand garlic though. We actually had to\nthrow out the garlic in the house because the smell is too much for me. Also,\nI eat more than I used to. My mother complains because she isn\u2019t used to me\neating so much. (But I think she\u2019d complain if I didn\u2019t eat enough too!) So\nshe fusses over me and I enjoy it. In fact I feel even better than I usually\ndo! My allergies seem to have disappeared \u2013 probably because of the good food\nI am eating. I am still active. My friends and family are shocked that I am\nstill doing errands up to such a late date. But life continues, doesn\u2019t it? I\nhaven\u2019t gained too much weight and I only started showing late into my 5th\nmonth. My worst symptom is the swollen feet! The baby is sitting more on my\nleft side so my left foot has swollen up to almost double its size. It looks\nscary and ugly. I worry my feet will grow permanently and never go back to how\nthey looked before! **MAMA HELP: Swollen feet (edema) during pregnancy can get\nworse as your due date nears. It may not be comfortable, but it\u2019s harmless and\nnormal. It should ease up overnight. If it doesn\u2019t, or if your hands or face\nbecome puffy, visit your clinic for a check-up.**\n\n",
