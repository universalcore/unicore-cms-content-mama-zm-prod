  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA Before my baby was born, the one thing I knew for sure\nwas that I made babies cry. How many times had an aunt or cousin put their\nbaby into my arms and the baby had cried? It was as if the baby knew I was not\nmeant to be a father! So just before mine came, I wondered: what if my baby\ndoes the same thing? I decided I never wanted this to happen. So I made a\npoint of finding out exactly why babies cry. I asked all my expert aunts! This\nis what they say: there are four reasons for a crying baby. It\u2019s hungry, it\u2019s\nin pain, it\u2019s got a wet nappy, or it\u2019s tired. But can\u2019t babies also just cry\nbecause they are sad? They can definitely be happy for no reason. The moment\nmy daughter gave me a real smile for the first time she was around 6 weeks\nold. It was my best moment! It was as if she had just become a real human\nbeing. Babies smile at their mothers and fathers and other people they\nrecognise. Then they grin and chuckle, gurgle and giggle. Now I seem to spend\na lot of time doing funny things just to make my girl laugh \u2013 I pull silly\nfaces, make animal noises, jump around like a frog, pull her toes. When she\ncries I do the 4-point check. I first make sure she\u2019s well fed, has a dry\nnappy, had a good night\u2019s sleep and doesn\u2019t have a thorn down her pants. When\nI\u2019m sure she\u2019s okay, then I work on cheering her up for real. I know some\ngreat songs. I can dance for her, read a story, tickle her feet\u2026 **MAMA HELP:\nA crying baby can cause a parent a lot of stress. First run through newDAD\u2019s\n4-point checklist to make sure your baby\u2019s comfortable. Once you\u2019re sure she\nis, it may be time to bring out the singing and the dancing!**\n\n",
