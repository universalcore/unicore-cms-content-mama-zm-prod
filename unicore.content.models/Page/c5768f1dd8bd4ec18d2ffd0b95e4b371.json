  "content": "Created by BabyCenter \r\n\r\nNow your baby can open her eyes and turn her head\r\ntowards light, even in the womb! She can hear now, and may kick and jump when\r\nshe hears loud sounds, and settle down when you sing and talk to her. \r\n\r\nSoon she\r\nwill get into a head-down position inside you. Her head will be born first, so\r\nshe turns upside down, ready for labour to begin. \r\n\r\nAs your bump gets bigger, it\r\nmay be difficult to get comfortable and sleep well. Lie on your side and put a\r\npillow between your legs so your bump is supported. You may start to feel some\r\nhip pain because the stretchy body tissue holding your hips to your pelvis may\r\nloosen. This is your body preparing for labour. Kneeling on your hands and\r\nknees may help. \r\n\r\nYou will need to make a plan for going to the midwife or\r\ndoctor in labour. Plan how you will travel there, and perhaps ask a friend or\r\nrelative if they will help. Talk to your family and make sure they know where\r\nyou need to go. \r\n\r\nGo to the health facility in late pregnancy so the nurse or\r\nhealth worker can check that you and the baby are well. They can tell you what\r\nyou need for the birth and when to go to the clinic in labour.\r\n\r\n",
