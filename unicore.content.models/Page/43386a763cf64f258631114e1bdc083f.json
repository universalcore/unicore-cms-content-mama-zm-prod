  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA Pregnancy should be an exciting time. All the things\r\nthat are happening inside my body should fill me with happiness. But at the\r\nmoment all I feel is worried. I worry about everything. What will the labour\r\nbe like? Could I miscarry? Will something go wrong? What if my waters break in\r\npublic? What if there is something wrong with my baby? I am also having\r\nnightmares when I sleep. When I wake up in the morning I don't have the energy\r\nto get out of bed. I can feel my baby moving around inside me but I'm filled\r\nwith thoughts about what could go wrong. I love this baby with all my heart.\r\nMy dream is that it will have a wonderful life. But the closer my due date\r\ncomes, the more I worry about what will happen to me and my baby. Is this\r\ncrazy? I wonder if it is normal to feel this way during pregnancy? In the\r\nbeginning I was so happy and excited. Perhaps it is just that I am scared of\r\nlabour, or scared of the reality of my situation. Either way, I love my baby\r\nand will do what is best. **MAMA HELP: Worry is one of the most common things\r\nmom report in pregnancy. It is more common than morning sickness and food\r\ncravings. You're not crazy. You're just pregnant!**\r\n\r\n",
