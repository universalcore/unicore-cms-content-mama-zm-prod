  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA The biggest question I had during my pregnancy was this\none: what will labour be like? What do contractions feel like? I asked friends\nwho'd given birth. Mostly, the answer I heard was that a contraction feels\nlike a bad menstrual cramp. Let me tell you what it felt like for me... Early\nlabour did feel like really strong menstrual cramps. It was uncomfortable,\nalmost painful \u2013 but manageable. I felt the dull ache at the bottom of my\nabdomen, just like cramps. That lasted about 2 to 3 hours. Then, as my labour\nprogressed, the pain got more intense. It didn't feel like period pains\nanymore. It got sharper and stronger. Luckily, there were breaks in the pain\nto rest. The pain would hit for a few seconds and then go away completely. I\ncould still function during the breaks. I was able to talk to my husband and\nmidwife. I felt I could handle what was happening to my body. Then the pain\ngot stronger. This was the final phase I had learned about. Breaks between\ncontractions were shorter. I won't lie; the pain was fierce. It was hard to\nfind a comfortable position. I just had to get through each contraction. There\nwere some moments towards the end that were scary. I felt tired and I just\nwanted it to stop. But the nurses were there to talk me through it all. They\ntold me to just handle one contraction at a time... Just one at a time. And\nwhen I started pushing, the pain seemed to get less. I just knew I had to push\nthat baby out! And I did. I don\u2019t want to scare anybody who is about to give\nbirth. I just want to prepare you for the most amazing experience of your\nlife. Labour is challenging. But if you know what to expect, it\u2019s a bit less\nscary. **MAMA HELP: Make sure you are ready for birth. Make plans get to the\nclinic on time. Ask friends about labour and get their tips. The more you know\nabout labour, the more likely you are to have a relaxed and healthy labour and\nbirth.**\n\n",
