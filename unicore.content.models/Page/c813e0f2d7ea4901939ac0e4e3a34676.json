  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA By the time my baby boy was 3 weeks old, I was tired. I\r\nhadn\u2019t slept a full night since the birth. I felt as if my baby only knew how\r\nto do three things: eat, sleep and cry! My mother-in-law saw that I was tired\r\nand tried to help me. She said she would look after him while I lay down for\r\nsome rest. I couldn\u2019t refuse. But handing over my tiny newborn felt harder\r\nthan hearing him cry! I watched how she held him. I didn\u2019t think that she was\r\ndoing it quite right \u2013 it wasn\u2019t the way I would do it. Even though I tried to\r\ntake a nap, I could hear my baby crying in the next room. I just wanted to go\r\nand take him back! I know mother-in-law was trying to help. And she did a good\r\njob raising her son because my husband is a wonderful man. But I was so\r\nprotective. I just wanted to hold my boy and not let him go to anyone else. I\r\nknow no harm will come to him, so I am trying to relax when others want to\r\nhold him. But I still get a secret thrill when I see that his smile for me is\r\nthe biggest! **MAMA HELP: You\u2019re a new mom \u2013 it\u2019s perfectly normal to not want\r\nto let your baby out of your sight. It will get easier in time. When family\r\nmembers want to hold your baby, try to see it as a good thing. They are\r\nhelpful and love her!**\r\n\r\n",
