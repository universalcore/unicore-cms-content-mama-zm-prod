  "content": "Created by BabyCenter \r\n\r\nAbout now, your baby will begin to focus both eyes on an\r\nobject. He will watch if you move a toy in front of him. But, when it\r\ndisappears, your baby will forget it exists! \r\n\r\nYour baby\u2019s memory gets better\r\nall the time. He will forget the toy, but he always knows your voice, and\r\nremembers this from when he was in your womb. \r\n\r\nWashing your baby can be fun for\r\nyou both. Get a clean towel and wash him with plenty of clean, safe water.\r\nMake sure the water feels warm but not hot. Most babies will relax and enjoy\r\nthe water. It may even remind him of being inside you. Never leave him alone\r\nwhen he is in water. \r\n\r\nIt is good to look at your baby\u2019s face and make eye\r\ncontact. This helps him begin to learn social skills. Soon, your baby will\r\nrecognise your face. He may prefer you to other people. He may make baby\r\nnoises and kick with pleasure when he sees you. You will see his first smile\r\nsoon! \r\n\r\nYour baby is also noticing his surroundings. Noises will start to\r\ninterest him, and he will like colourful patterns. \r\n\r\nBy now, your baby may be\r\nable to lift his head and chest when he is lying on his belly. Learning to\r\ncontrol his head is an important milestone for him. \r\n\r\nYour baby is also\r\nlistening to you more each day. When you speak, he may stop what he is doing\r\nto listen to you. Keep talking to him, repeating his noises. Speaking to your\r\nbaby will comfort him and encourage him to talk to you.\r\n\r\n",
