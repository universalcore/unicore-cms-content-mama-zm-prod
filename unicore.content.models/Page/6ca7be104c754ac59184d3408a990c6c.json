  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA The closer we get to the birth of our child, the\nstronger I feel. It is so clear in my mind: I want to care for this child and\nsupport it. I have never looked after anything before \u2013 not even my little\ncousins who were bullied in the schoolyard. I always wished I could help them\nback then. But now I know I really can help my own child. I feel like I\u2019m\nbecoming a better man! Being a father will be good for me. It\u2019s reminding me\nthat I do have the power to protect others from danger. I am filled with such\nhappiness when I think of myself as the father and the caregiver. I want to be\nfaithful to my wife and to this child. I don\u2019t want to be a father who is only\nthere for the big moments in a child\u2019s life. Or the man who stands up only to\ndiscipline the child when it misbehaves. I want to be there for every part of\nthis kid\u2019s life. When I think about the job of a father, I cannot think of any\nother job that could be more important! **MAMA HELP: Being a father is a job\nfor life. Even if you are no longer in a relationship with a child\u2019s mother,\nthere are responsibilities. These are to your child. But being a father comes\nwith all the rewards as well. You\u2019ll feel love and pride as your watch your\nhealthy, happy child grow up.**\n\n",
