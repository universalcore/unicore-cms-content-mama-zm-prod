  "content": "Created by BabyCenter Your baby may be getting ready to be born. Most babies\r\nturn head down about now. You may notice that your baby drops down into your\r\npelvis. This makes it easier to breathe, but it also means that you need to\r\nurinate more often! You may have swelling lower down between your legs where\r\nyou can feel your baby\u2019s head. Rest lying down, with your feet on a pillow\r\nwhen you can, to reduce the swelling. Your baby has developed all his internal\r\norgans fully now. Inside you, he is swallowing the fluid in your womb and then\r\npassing it out again. His lungs are fully grown and will work as soon he takes\r\nhis first breath. Try to rest each day and think about the baby you are\r\ngrowing. Soon you will see him. Your baby can hear your voice and will\r\nrecognise you when you say hi to him for the first time! You may feel fewer\r\nbig movements because it is quite cramped inside your womb. But you should\r\nstill feel your baby kick regularly. If you are not sure, sit quietly after a\r\nmeal and notice how often he kicks. If you do not count several kicks see your\r\nhealth worker.\r\n\r\n",
