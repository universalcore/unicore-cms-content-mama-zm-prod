  "content": "Brought to you by MAMA I have always been tiny. But for the year after I gave\r\nbirth to my boy, people told me I looked like a walking skeleton. A week after\r\nbirth I was already back in my old clothes. But the weight loss didn\u2019t stop\r\nthere. My baby seemed to be always attached to my breast. And as he fed, I got\r\nthinner and thinner. I had been breastfeeding for 9 months when I caught sight\r\nof myself in a shop window in town. I was shocked: I was just skin and bone.\r\nOthers had kept asking if I was sick. So I decided to see a doctor. He told me\r\nthat my body had stopped absorbing nutrients and that it was going to take\r\nsome time to come right. I was put on an eating programme of healthy food. I\r\nhad to eat a lot of energy food and fresh food to get vitamins. The doctor\r\nalso told me to start moving my baby onto solid foods. He showed me how to do\r\nthis. Now that I have started to gain strength, I feel much better. I have not\r\ngained any weight, but I have not lost any either. For a long time, the\r\nthought of another pregnancy scared me. I didn\u2019t think my body would cope. But\r\nI am starting to think I could do it again! This time round, I would eat\r\ncarefully and make sure to put a lot of good food in my body. Now I know that\r\nI must take care of myself so that I can take care of my family. **MAMA HELP:\r\nIf you are not sure you can stick to a healthy diet on your own, ask your\r\nhealthcare worker for help. You will need to eat foods rich in good fats,\r\nvitamins and minerals. These are essential for a healthy baby and a healthy\r\nmom.**\r\n\r\n",
